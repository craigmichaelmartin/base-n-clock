    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective date: February 15, 2026</p>

    <p>Base N Clock ("the App") is a free screensaver and clock application available on the Roku platform. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the App handles information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or usage data. The App runs entirely on your local device and does not communicate with any external servers.</p>

    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App accesses only the current date and time provided by your Roku device in order to display the clock. No other device features, identifiers, or data are accessed.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect any data from any user, including children under the age of 13. The App is safe for users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If this Privacy Policy is updated, the revised version will be posted at this URL with a new effective date. Because the App collects no data, material changes are unlikely.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository or contact the developer directly.</p>
